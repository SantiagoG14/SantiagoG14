## About
I am currently pursuing a Bachelor of Science in Informatics at the University of Washington, where I am currently learning about user-centered design and research methods that reduce bias.

I am particularly passionate about tools that improve my developer productivity. Neovim is my editor of choice because it empowers me to edit files fast and enjoyably. Chaining these motions is surprisingly satisfying. I pair it with Tmux to be able to run multiple terminal sessions at once.

I am also currently working at Teutsch Partners. In my role, I bring designs to life using TypeScript, React, and Firebase. During my first months, I greatly contributed to a fully responsive web reservation system, leading the development of the new redesign of the client portal.

# Hey, I'm Santiago 👋🏽

I am an undergrad student at the **University of Washington**, pursuing a Computer Science or related field degree. I am passionate about developing products that exceed client's needs and expectations, especially interested in creating great user experiences.

I am currently developing the front-end for [Societas](https://github.com/hcp-uw/societas/tree/main/Frontend), working with the latest React technologies.

Also currently learning all about functional programming using Haskell.
